### Notes

* Use [Mpp-Viewer](https://www.seavusprojectviewer.com/online-project-viewer?cid=CMP-02144-G1P3V6&gclid=CjwKCAjwtYXmBRAOEiwAYsyl3H4s80TU68gvydkDb-jv4u5_x7cHFop8vqSc4KN4YvnVIWMXXF4oSRoCUPEQAvD_BwE) to open the MS Project files (if you doesn't have MS Project).
* Some data was replaced with dumbs to avoid real names or images. To reproduce the things I sent I did not want to delete the files. This is also the reason for the four mpp files, each of them was sent.
* The most important things are *Projektdefinition+Risiken+Ressourcen*, *Dokumentation meiner Handlungen*, the MPP and the *Projektabschluss*. I guess sending everything else (like images and some really specific documentations) was more than neccessary.
* This was graded with an 1,0. So having a similar granularity should be enough, I would even say you can achieve a 1,0 with less than this.3
* Sorry for the missing mail texts and dates, but I doesn't have them anymore. Wasn't interesting either.
